# Analysis-of-the-determinants-of-life-satisfaction-among-the-elderly
The project analyzes the impact of economic, social, and health factors on the well-being of elderly individuals and their families.

Using data from the SHARE survey (2011, 2013, and 2015), it examines how these variables influence self-perceived life satisfaction. Happiness is measured through a dummy variable for life satisfaction, with household income as the key independent variable. The model includes socio-demographic and health-related controls to better explain variations in life satisfaction.

The project was conducted in collaboration with Stefano Amadori.
